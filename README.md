Goals of the course and assignments:
- Learning foundational conceptual tools needed to understand computational models of linguistic structure.
- Understanding the notion of a model of computation and how it can be applied to understand aspects of linguistic structure.
- Understanding how to develop empirical evaluations of such models.
- Learning a bunch of specific, useful skills such as programming in Clojure.
